**Save Tray 5e** is a lightweight module that enhances D&D 5e saving throw chat messages by adding a compact "save tray" - similar to the targets tray used for attack rolls. It lists all targeted creatures and their save results at a glance. Players can roll their own saves directly from the tray (permission-based), and the tray updates automatically as rolls come in.

(optional) Automatically targets Save Tray participants for damage rolls and presets damage multipliers based on save results (e.g., half or none on save).

The module is intended as a possible workaround for the following issue: https://github.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e/issues/3897
